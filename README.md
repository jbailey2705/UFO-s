- HTML
- Bootstrap

## Overview
We were tasked to create and display a table, organizing data stored in a JavaScript array. The website created through JavaScript will allow visitors to the site to filter by certain data points based on date, city, state, & shape. Information in the site uses information stored in CSS/HTML & Bootstrap, generating the aesthetics of the Webpage

## Results

### Filterable List
As a visitor to the webpage, you can filter the list to pull data of importance to each visitor of the site

The filter list allows vistiors to filter by a singlt line such as Date

Or multiple fields to find the information needed

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
The page does have a few drawbacks, such as;
- User of the page must know specific dates, city, or shapes in order to properly search the content
- Correct usage of Upper/Lower case
- Spellings & can not have spaces at the end, for example you user could not type "roundrock", "round rock ", or  "Round Rock", of typed this was user would return no data. Instead the user would need to use the correct spelling as "round rock" to pull up information for the city of round rock. 

### Recommendations:
1. Add additional customizations such as;
- clickable buttons
- dropdown lists
- auto filter
2. Add functionality to have the ability to pull content from a live source that's not limited to the US, enhance the user experiance by making the site Global
3. Add an area that has the "Latest News" that will show articles with the most up-to-date information of reported UFO sightings
